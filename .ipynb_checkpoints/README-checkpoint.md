This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository. This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science. Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration. This project is a reorganized version of the LIGO Open Science tutorial focused on reproducibility and ease of use. It adds more structure and tests compared to the HW 2 repository.
